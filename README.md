# Plant Disease Detection System Using Python Libraries

This project is a machine learning-based solution that detects diseases in plants using image processing and deep learning techniques. It trains a model on plant leaf images and then predicts the health status of the plant. The project is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and other Python libraries.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

| File/Folder          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `.ipynb_checkpoints/` | Jupyter Notebook checkpoints (auto-generated). |
| `Test_Plant.ipynb`    | Notebook to test the trained model on plant images. |
| `Train_Plant.ipynb`   | Notebook to train the model on a dataset of plant images. |
| `home.jpg`            | Image asset for the home page or UI. |
| `home_page.jpeg`      | Another home page image used for visualization/UI. |
| `main.py`             | Main Python script to run the Plant Disease Detection system. |
| `requirements.txt`    | Contains all Python library dependencies for the project. |
| `training_hist.json`  | JSON file storing the model training history (accuracy, loss, etc.). |
